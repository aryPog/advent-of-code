# advent-of-code
My main goal for 2024 was to finish the advent of code using haskell 
(which I dont know btw) but it was proven to be a litle (too) hard.
So, the goal became just finish it. Some days I wrote all the code, 
some days I borrowed it, and some days I stole it all the code. So, for 
2025 (a new year,a new me, and a lot of time till christmas) I'll try to 
get good enough so I can do it all on my owm.
